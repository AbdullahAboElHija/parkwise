More In-Depth Commit Description and Message:

    API pdf file because Gemini can't seem to let go of canvas or even
    give a text summary, he wants to style it into a document...

    API.pdf includes all the currently supported API routes, if it is 
    to be deleted, no problem in that (in fact I would delete it).

CLARIFICAITON:

    A route specifying or requiring /:id in the end can be done as follows:

Example endpoint:

    I want to use GET localhost:3000/api/v1/parkings/:id

    do

    GET localhost:3000/api/v1/parkings/6923976d6f55833fdee0fba9

    * Notice that there is no : mark in the actual use case.

Good night <3
